# HOW THIS WORKS
# zsh ALWAYS reads /etc/zsh/zshenv first. You can't overwrite it
# my /etc/zsh/zshenv contains `export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh/"`
# so I can't just set ZDOTDIR in this script, as
# it will be overwritten in aforementioned file
#
# Instead, I overwrite $HOME before calling zsh;
# this way, ZDOTDIR gets assigned new path:
# /home/heather/.config/zsh/zsh-read-line/.config/zsh/
#
# Yes, this is stupid and ugly, but I can't think of any other way
HOME="$HOME/.config/zsh/zsh-read-line/" \

  exec zsh -i
